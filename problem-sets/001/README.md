# Notes: 
  * Self-grading is hard, especially when it comes to code. 
  * The differences between Rust and Python are wide.
  * A lot of Rust tutorials and stackoverflow questions are outdated.
  * If anyone finds this and thinks I was too generous, send a pull request with your criticisms.

  Final Grade: **100%**

# 001-c
  Returned *very close* results, code is a bit convoluted, but some of that has to do with Rust.

  Final Grade: **89%**
